# ML_challenge

It's a machine learning programming challenge to build and train a classifier given a labeled dataset and then use it to infer the labels of a given unlabeled evaluation dataset. The goal is to achieve a higher accuracy of your model.

## Dataset

It's a dataset with 3 labels and 10 features. Train with [TrainOnMe.csv](https://github.com/jhan15/ML_challenge/blob/master/Dataset/TrainOnMe.csv), and test your algorithm with [EvaluateOnMe.csv](https://github.com/jhan15/ML_challenge/blob/master/Dataset/EvaluateOnMe.csv), which is unlabeled.
